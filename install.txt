xc_basic installation.
 
0.- Patience (please).

    I'ts not always easy to verify than installation works properly
    (obviously the developer's machine is the worst place to test
    installation process). If you find a bug in the installation please 
    feel free to write to l.pereztato@gmail.com.

1.- Pre-requisites.

    xc_basic is a C++ (and fortran) library, so a C++ and a Fortran
    compiler are necessary. The library and test programs were tested
    with GNU C++ and Fortran version 4.8.2
    

    - You will also need CMake also ((http://www.cmake.org/).
    - The library is suposed to be used over Linux, maybe it's possible
      to use it with other Unix flavors.
    - Libraries needed:

         -Boost c++ libraries (<http://www.boost.org/>).
         -GLib library (libglib2.0-dev).
         -GTK GIMP Tookit (libgtk2.0-dev, libgtkgl2.0-dev,
               libgtkglextmm-x11-1.2-dev, libgtkmm-2.4-dev).
         -SQLite 3 development files (libsqlite3).
         -VTK (Visualization ToolKit <http://www.vtk.org>).
         -X11 (libX11-dev).
         -HDF5 (www.hdfgroup.org). Salome interface.
         -MED V3.0 (www.code-aster.org/outils/med). Salome interface.

      You can find a list of the Ubuntu (or Debian) packages you need to
      fulfill the installation in "doc/needed_packages.txt". If you have
      a Debian, Ubuntu or (probably) Linux Mint distribution you can
      run the "doc/install_*whatever*_packages.sh" to install all
      needed packages (*whatever* can be debian, ubuntu16,...).

2.- Make a directory to place files inside (Debian administrators 
    know what to do):

    sudo mkdir /usr/local/src/prgs
    sudo chown yourUserName.yourUserName /usr/local/src/prgs

3.- Unzip the files is "prgs" directory:

    cp xc_basic.tar.gz /usr/local/src/prgs
    cd /usr/local/src/prgs
    tar -xzvf xc_basic.tar.gz

4.- Make a directory to compile sources.

    mkdir /usr/local/src/prgs/build
    mkdir /usr/local/src/prgs/build/xc_basic


6.- Use CMake for Makefile generation.

    cd /usr/local/src/prg/build/xc_basic
    cmake ../../prg/xc_basic/src

7.- Compile code.

    make

8.- Install library.

    sudo make install

8.- Verify that in the '/usr/local/lib' there is a file named 'libxc_basic.a'.
